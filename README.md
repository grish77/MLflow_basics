# MLflow_basics
MLflow is a versatile, expandable, open-source platform for managing workflows and artifacts across the machine learning lifecycle. It has built-in integrations with many popular ML libraries, but can be used with any library, algorithm, or deployment tool. It provides tools and APIs that help data scientists and developers track, reproduce, deploy, and collaborate on machine learning tasks.

### Some of the important features of MLflow involve:
1. _Model Tracking_:
   The MLflow Tracking component is an API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files when running your machine learning code and for later visualizing the results. For many popular ML libraries,Model tracking can be easily implemented in the ML code by simply adding mlflow.autolog() function call. If we are using one of the supported libraries, this will automatically log the parameters, metrics, and artifacts of the run. 
MLflow Tracking is organized around the concept of runs, which are executions of some piece of data science code. In each run, the information about the model such as code version, start and end time, source, parameters, metrics, artifacts, etc. MLflow Tracking is organized around the concept of runs, which are executions of some piece of data science code.

The diagram above depicts the tracking of multiple runs of ML experiments and comparision of the performance metrics of each run.

2. _MLFlow Models_:
MLflow Models is one of the features or components of MLflow that deals with model packaging and deployment in a very convenient way. It allows us to easily package and share ML models in a standardized format. With MLflow Models, we can define a model as a combination of code, environment dependencies, and serialized model artifacts. This definition is called a model "flavor." MLflow supports various flavors that correspond to different machine learning frameworks and tools. For example, it has built-in support for popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. Each flavor provides a set of conventions and tools for packaging and serving models trained with the respective framework. Once we define a model with a specific flavor, MLflow Models enable! us to deploy and serve the model in different deployment environments. It provides a simple way to deploy models as RESTful web services, allowing us to make predictions using HTTP requests. Additionally, MLflow Models supports integration with cloud platforms like Azure ML and AWS SageMaker, enabling us to deploy models to cloud-based serving infrastructure.

The artifacts folder of the model trained enabling MLflow contains the necessary information about the specific run of the model and its dependencies. As depicted in the above diagram, the model folder contains ML model file that is a JSON file that describes the model's metadata and provides information about the model's flavor, version, and dependencies. It typically includes details such as the model's name, version, input and output schema, and the flavor used for packaging the model. If we have used a Conda environment to train the model, MLflow may generate a Conda environment file that lists the dependencies required to run the model. This file specifies the necessary packages and their versions. The folder may also contain the information about the requiremens for running the model in other environments.

3. _MLFlow Projects_:
MLflow Projects provide a standardized format for packaging and reproducing code in a machine learning project. We can define dependencies, specify entry points, and run the code in a consistent environment across different platforms. Each project is simply a directory of files, or a Git repository, containing your code. MLflow can run some projects based on a convention for placing files in this directory (for example, a conda.yaml file is treated as a Conda environment), but we can describe our project in more detail by adding a MLproject file, which is a YAML formatted text file. Each project can specify several properties like name, entry points, environment, etc.
